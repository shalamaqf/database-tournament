Title : "Video Games Tournament"

Description : A simple database called "Video Games Tournament" that manages players and their participation in various tournaments. It keeps track of which players join which tournaments and stores details of each tournament, such as name, location, and tournament's date.

Technologies Used : This project uses PostgreSQL for database management and SQL for querying.

Installation Instructions :
    * Clone this repository to your local machine and follow these instructions to set up the database.
    * Include :
        1. Installation of PostgreSQL.
        2. Running the SQL script to set up the database and tables.

Features : 
  * Create and read player, tournament, and registration records. (We can add some features like update and delete).
  * Track which players join which tournaments, and vice versa.
  * Ensure players don't join the same tournament multiple times and verify that registration dates do not overlap for a player.

Usage : You can use the following SQL queries to view details about players, tournaments, and registrations in the database.

Future Improvement : In the future, I plan to add more features, such as a match table that stores details like scores, wins, and losses. Additionally, I will create a team table to manage which players belong to which teams. These enhancements will allow the database to handle more complex data and provide a more comprehensive view of the tournaments.
